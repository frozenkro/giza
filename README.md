# giza

An attempt to make a binding for the popular [cairo](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/cairo/cairo) graphics library with some idiomatic Zig elements (and some that will make true Zig enjoyers' skin crawl).

Many thanks to [jackdbd](https://github.com/jackdbd) for his [implementation](https://github.com/jackdbd/zig-cairo) of such binding.
