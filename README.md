# giza

An attempt to make a binding for the popular [cairo](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/cairo/cairo) graphics library with some idiomatic Zig elements (and some that will make true Zig enjoyers' skin crawl).

Many thanks to [jackdbd](https://github.com/jackdbd) for his [implementation](https://github.com/jackdbd/zig-cairo) of such binding.

You can find coverage info [here](https://github.com/koenigskraut/giza/blob/master/coverage.md). Current progress is 68.5% regarding library functionality, **but** it generally should work already. The only two parts that are missing are fonts and devices. If you only need cairo to draw some PNG or SVG files, that is already covered!
